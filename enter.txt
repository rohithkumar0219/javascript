History of JavaScript (35)

1995 Created by Brendan Elch at Netscape in just 10 days.

Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, finally renamed JavaScript (even though it's not related to Java).

Designed to add Interactivity to web pages.

Standardized under ECMAScript (first standard in 1997).

Grew over time from small scripts ->full web apps ->backend (node.js) -> desktop & mobile apps.
