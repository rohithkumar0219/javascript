What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, multi-paradigm programming language.

It runs mainly in the browser but also on servers (Node.js).

It's dynamic (types can change), event-driven, and supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles.

Often paired with HTML + CSS to build web apps.
